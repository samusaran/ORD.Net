# ORD.Net

This is a simple app to order lunch from work, without going through the hassle of talking to your colleagues.

ORD.Net is the 5th version of a joke-app born in our company 13 years ago, that had grown to be a much more reliable app and a sandbox for experimenting new knowledge.

You are free to clone the code, play around and maybe modify it to match your colleagues needs.
